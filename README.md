## How to Work on .html Files
> We have multiple .html files such as 100.html or 103.html and more in this page. Inside each file has a line in the "<body>" area that connects to a GitHub issue. The general purpose of this .html file is to link a QR Code to this specific issue. The issues assigned may change by changing the link in the .html file.
> 
> The application of construction science provides the ability to use a laminated tag with the QR Codes multiple times by re-using them to multiple properties for construction projects. This enables construction workers get ahead in the use of technology in finding multiple projects and be able to choose.
