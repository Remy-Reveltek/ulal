## How to Work on .html Files
> We have multiple .html files such as 101.html or 103.html and more in this page. Inside each file has a line in the body area that connects to a GitHub issue. The general purpose of this .html file is to link a QR Code to this specific issue. The issues assigned may change by changing the link in the .html file.

This is a sample of how our QR Code tags look like,

> The application of construction science provides the ability to use a laminated tag with the QR Codes many times by re-using them to different properties for construction projects. This enables construction workers get ahead in the use of technology in finding multiple construction projects and be able to choose.

### 1. **Find an available .html file**
1. Click on a .html file, for example 100.html.
2. Find the line that has the a href=

4. Open a new tab and paste the link.
5. Check if the issue in the link is "Close".
6. If the issue is close then the 100.html file is available to link to another issue.

### 2. **Link a GitHub Issue** 
1. Find a property to work on its Issues at https://github.com/orgs/United-Home/repositories . For example, the Issues at <a href="https://github.com/United-Home/2405-45th-St/issues"> 2405-45th-St </a>
<img width="798" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61100293/217858482-0886d55a-a136-45da-bd30-942407ccdb0a.png">.

2. The issue should have a written note or a comment as to which ULAL QR Code it is currently assigned to. 
3. If you can't find the designated QR Code, then comment on the task to inform the Admin you're working on this issue of integrating. Or you can help by figuring it out yourself and comment the QR Code.
